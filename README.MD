# odin-project_etch-a-sketch

A simple drawing app using javascript and css Flexbox.

Uses pure javascript to implement a drawing game similar to the old Etch-A-Sketch toy. Has several drawing modes, including "darken", "lighten", "random", and "HSV Random" which produces random colors, but lets the user control the Saturation and Value aspects of the color.

Due to the nature of the implementation, large values for canvas size (square div density) can have negative performance impacts on computers without significant resources.
